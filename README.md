# AI-Survival
An AI project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Course (CNG 462)


# Base Game Folders
The game itself is a Unity Tutorial Project: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/survival-shooter-tutorial 

# Repository Content
This repository contains only the scripts that are used in the game. Some of the scripts are related to gameplay mechanics, and some others are AI related.

1 - The scripts in Assets -> Game Folder -> Scripts -> Game Scripts are the scripts that are from base game, but I have edited them for my project.

2 - The scripts in Assets -> Assets Package -> Complete Game are unchanged base game scripts

3 - The scripts in Assets -> Game Folder -> Scripts, with no further foldering are my AI related scripts

4 - The script in Assets -> Game Folder -> Scripts -> Spawner is my own spawner prefab script that I developed for my own projects.
